Blender Animation Library Add-on
This Blender add-on streamlines the process of saving and applying animations, making it easier to reuse motion data efficiently. The add-on allows users to:

Save animations with keyframe data for selected bones or all bones.
Load animations from a library and apply them to compatible rigs.
Manage animation previews by saving thumbnails alongside animation files.
Current Issue: Missing Thumbnails
While the add-on successfully saves animations, the thumbnail previews do not appear in Blender, despite being saved correctly. This makes it difficult to visually browse the animation library. If anyone has experience resolving this issue, any help would be appreciated!
